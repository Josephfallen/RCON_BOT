# How to Contribute to Pavlov-Bot

## Who can contribute?

* Anyone can follow, fork, clone, or create issues and suggestions in line with the license (GPL3.0).
* Any pull requests into this repo will be managed by Makupi and Invicta-nz

## Find a bug?

First off, if it's a security bug, start off with a private message to @invicta-nz or @makupi so that any known users of the software can patch it before we create a public issue.

For any other kind of bug, feel free to search through existing issues. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. A template for submitting bugs exists, so try and use that.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug? or adds a feature/fixes an existing issue?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Currently there are no test suites or coding practises specifically being adhered to - just do your best. Worst case, we'll work together to refactor something.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of software aren't what we really need right now, but if it's what you feel like doing, you do you!

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Ask any question about how to use Pavlov-bot in the Pavlov VR #pc-custom-servers channel.

If you can't find the server, message invicta-nz privately, but don't expect a fast reply - we've got lives.

## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

Currently the documentation is self-contained in the Readme.MD - so do your best and treat it like a regular issue. If you have a better idea of how to manage the docs, just open an issue.

See you in VR.
